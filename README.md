# Human_Activity_Recognition
The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed <br\>

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKINGUPSTAIRS, WALKINGDOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, data get is of  3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity  <br\>


what I have done in this project: 
1. **Importing necessary libraries** 
2. **Loading data** 
3. **Data preprocessing** 
    - Checking for duplicates 
    - Checking for missing values  
    -  Checking for class imbalance  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
    -  Analysing tBodyAccMag-mean feature  
    -  Analysing Angle between X-axis and gravityMean feature  
    -  Analysing Angle between Y-axis and gravityMean feature 
    -  Visualizing data using t-SNE 
5. **Model Prediction and Evaluation** 
    -  Logistic regression model with Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation   
    -  Linear SVM model with Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation  
    -  Kernel SVM model with Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation  
    -  Decision tree model with Hyperparameter tuning and crossvalidation 
    -  Random forest model with Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation
